There are lots of things to consider before committing to a research plan and most of them don't depend on any data analysis.

Issues related to the study question:

- Is there a gap in the literature?
- In what situations would the results be useful to know, and how might they change the public health approach to those situations?
- Is there public interest in the question? If so, how might the public interpret the findings?

Issues related to the data:

- Will there reasonable statistical power to answer the question?
- How much unmeasured confounding is there likely to be?
- How much missclassification? Any dependent error?
