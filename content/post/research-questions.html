<p>There are lots of things to consider before committing to a research plan and most of them donâ€™t depend on any data analysis.</p>
<p>Issues related to the study question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a gap in the literature?</li>
<li>In what situations would the results be useful to know, and how might they change the public health approach to those situations?</li>
<li>Is there public interest in the question? If so, how might the public interpret the findings?</li>
</ul>
<p>Issues related to the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will there reasonable statistical power to answer the question?</li>
<li>How much unmeasured confounding is there likely to be?</li>
<li>How much missclassification? Any dependent error?</li>
</ul>
