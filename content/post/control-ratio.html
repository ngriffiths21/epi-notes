<p>In case-control studies, there is a rule of thumb that you only need to sample about three or four times as many controls as cases. The cases are usually the limiting factor, especially when the disease is rare and they are difficult to find, so it makes sense to sample more controls than cases to boost statistical power. But at a certain point, the cost of managing additional controls is greater than the statistical power they add. This is especially true when it is expensive to assess exposure status. So epidemiologists usually stop when they have a ratio of three or four to one.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s pretty easy to test this to see if it makes sense. <code>make_ci_plot(risk_un, RD, p_exp)</code> is a function that constructs a sample from a population with unexposed risk <code>risk_un</code>, risk difference <code>RD</code>, and exposure prevalence <code>p_exp</code>. It uses a range of control to case ratios, from 0.5 to 7, and plots the width of the resulting confidence interval.</p>

<p>As expected, the confidence interval is very wide with low ratios, but past four there is little to be gained by increasing the control to case ratio.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the source population will affect the confidence interval widths (especially the exposure prevalence), but the shape of the curve is always the same.</p>
