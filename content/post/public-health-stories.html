<h2>The Melon Lady and the janitor</h2>
<p>At Bill Bicknell’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIi6g1m_n6k">last lecture</a>, he told the story of the janitor and the Melon Lady. One day at work he noticed that the fruit stand on the corner threw out all the leftover fruit in a dumpster at the end of the day. He waited a few days, continued to see the stand do this each day, and then decided to take a watermelon home with him. He did this a few times. Then a janitor came to him and was pretty bold, saying, “Commissioner, I hate to bother you, but women come here at night and depend on that dumpster for food.” And Dr. Bicknell says he always thought of the Melon Lady, the person who wasn’t at the table, whenever he had to make a decision.</p>

<h2>Public health vs. clinical medicine</h2>
<p>At my town’s Board of Health meeting recently, there was discussion about the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and the first case diagnosed in the down. Someone noted that there would be more, adding that doctors were advising patients with suspicious symptoms to stay home and forego testing. Lacking an accurate count, they talked a little about preparations.</p>
<p>They moved on to the next idea. It was a proposal by a public health physician to protect those 70 and older, the highest risk group for dying of this disease. The proposal was to gather the list of every 70+ resident and mail them a letter with a number to call if they have fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Suddenly, the board could identify most high-risk suspect cases within days. Having identified them, they would contact-trace and advise self-quarantine, just like they would with a confirmed positive. This is the work that saves lives: a clever proposal by a public health professional who cared deeply about his town (he listed his personal phone number in the letter), who had extensive experience, and who understood that to really understand a population you have to go out and measure it — you can’t just ask its doctors.</p>
