<p>I like to think about reading in three distinct steps: gather raw information, put it into context, and then consider the overall impact.</p>
<div id="gather-information-in-an-unbiased-way" class="section level2">
<h2>Gather information in an unbiased way</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Infer the overall research question from the title, end of the introduction, and/or “measures” section</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the ideal study design?</li>
<li>What is the most likely finding?</li>
<li>What kinds of evidence would change understanding?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Carefully look through the tables; go back into the methods to answer any questions about variable definitions and methodology</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there surprising results (whether related to the research question or not)? What should be highlighted in the text?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Read through the whole results section for any additional results, and compare with the tables</p>
<ul>
<li>How do all the results impact the research question? What is the broader narrative or conclusion?</li>
<li>What sources of bias should be considered?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="think-about-the-results-in-context" class="section level2">
<h2>Think about the results in context</h2>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Read through the entire introduction and discussion</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the motivation for the study?</li>
<li>What are the conclusions the authors make, and do they make sense?</li>
<li>In the context of prior work as laid out in the introduction and discussion, do the results or conclusions change?</li>
<li>Are important sources of bias considered?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="consider-the-impact" class="section level2">
<h2>Consider the impact</h2>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Re-read the whole article to understand the motivating theory, the model, and what future action is recommended</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is being blamed for the problem?</li>
<li>Who is considered responsible for fixing it?</li>
<li>What kind of solution is being proposed (more research, policy, public health or medical intervention, etc)?</li>
<li>Who may be harmed or helped as a result?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Read the news</p>
<ul>
<li>Same questions as above</li>
<li>How well does the news convey all this information?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="other-resources" class="section level2">
<h2>Other resources</h2>
