<h2>Model structure</h2>
<p>An ARIMA model includes two types of parameters, autoregressive (AR, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>) and moving average (MA, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>). It can also be differenced (subtracting the values at a certain lag). This is the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(1 - \phi_1 B - ... - \phi_p B^p) (1 - B)^d y_t = c + (1 + ... + \theta_q B^q) \epsilon_t\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(B y_t = y_{t-1}\)</span> (from the <a href="https://otexts.com/fpp2/arima.html">Forecasting</a> textbook).</p>
<p>This is called an <span class="math inline">\(ARIMA(p,d,q)\)</span> model. We could also have a seasonal model, written <span class="math inline">\(ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m\)</span>, in which case we just multiply terms like <span class="math inline">\((1 - \Phi_1 B^m - ... - \Phi_p B^{p*m})\)</span> to the equation.</p>

<div id="choosing-an-order" class="section level2">
<h2>Choosing an order</h2>
<p>Plot at least the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF). SAS also plots the IACF.</p>
<p>First decide if it’s stationary or nonstationary, and difference if nonstationary. If the model is nonstationary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time series will have a trend, OR a regular seasonal pattern</li>
<li>The ACF will decay slowly</li>
</ul>
<p>Then choose the orders for the AR and MA terms.</p>
<p>If the model is pure AR (q = 0):</p>
<ul>
<li>It will have an ACF that decays or is sinusoidal</li>
<li>It will have a PACF that has significant terms up to lag <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> but none beyond that</li>
</ul>
<p>MA models have the reverse: decaying PACFs, cutoffs in their ACFs.</p>
<p>If the best model has both MA and AR terms, the plots won’t be useful.</p>
<p>If there are seasonal terms with order <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the same pattern will be visible at each multiple of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. For example, if there is a seasonal term <span class="math inline">\((1,0,0)_4\)</span>, there will be a decaying ACF at lags 4, 8, 12, etc.</p>
<p>The notes from PROC ARIMA describe the IACF, which behaves like the PACF, but can also indicate overdifferencing. If there is overdifferencing, the IACF looks like an ACF from a nonstationary process (it decays very slowly). If it is nonstationary, the IACF will look like the ACF from an MA model (cutoff after a certain lag).</p>
</div>
<div id="regression" class="section level2">
<h2>Regression</h2>
<p>If adding other predictors, it is the residuals that are being modeled, so these should be plotted to check for order. After picking an order the model can be rerun with ARMA error terms.</p>
