Outline:

- Nested models, intercept and intercept + one linear predictor
  - define likelihood
  - define parameter standard error
- Info theory
  - entropy
  - K-L divergence
  - deviance = -2L
- Model testing: impact of constraints on in-sample fit
  - Likelihood ratio
  - Score function
  - Wald statistic
- Model selection: impact of constraints on out-of-sample fit
  - Information criteria
  
  
in another post:

- Model diagnostics:
  - H&L calibration = mean subgroup prediction vs mean subgroup outcome
  - discrimination = accurate comparison between pairs
